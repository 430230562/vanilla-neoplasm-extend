block.vne-incubator.name = Incubator
block.vne-incubator.description = Device used to stimulate and cultivate trace venous liquid in the environment.
block.vne-incubator.details = On Erikel, venous liquid residues are everywhere.\nWe must carefully control cultivation scale and strictly deactivate, or these restless organisms may escape control.

block.vne-ammonia-plant.name = Ammonia Plant
block.vne-ammonia-plant.description = Factory for synthesizing ammonia, combining nitrogen and hydrogen under high temperature and pressure. A key part of modern chemical industry.
block.vne-ammonia-plant.details = Although the Haber process has existed for centuries, it remains the mainstream synthesis method.\n\nPerhaps electrochemical methods could be used if suitable electrode materials are available.

block.vne-watergas-stove.name = Water-Gas Stove

block.vne-biomass-reactor.name = Biomass Reactor
block.vne-biomass-reactor.description = Our engineers proposed a stunning idea: using the heat from venous liquid growth to generate electricity. This is the result.\n\nBut honestly, its stability is questionable: too unstable and it explodes, too much venous liquid and it explodes; plus, it causes significant pollution.\n\nIf possible, better to use a proper reactor.
block.vne-biomass-reactor.details = Actually, it has a nickname: Double-Boom Reactor.
